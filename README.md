## How does HackerGPT work?

When you ask a question, it's sent to our server. We verify user authenticity and manage the number of questions you can submit based on your user type (free or plus). Our next step is to search our database for information closely matching your question. If we find a strong match, we incorporate this into the AI's response process. Finally, your question is securely passed to either Google or OpenAI for processing. Importantly, we only send the question and previous ones from the same chat without any personal information. The response you receive varies based on the selected module:
   - **HackerGPT**: A tuned version of Palm 2 with semantic search on our data.
   - **GPT-4 Turbo**: The latest and greatest from OpenAI, paired with our unique prompt.
